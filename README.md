#### [The questions in Web3](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2022&#x2F;01&#x2F;17&#x2F;Understanding-Web3.html) 
*My complete Linkedin is full of the word web3, I am seeing more and more startups coming in this area every day. Like other technical buzzwords, the docs on web3 are still very vague and are just full of what they are building but the why part is not clearly depicted. In this blog I am listing down all the questions I am having right now and in the next blogs I will be finding the answer for each question.
Using Web3, we are trying to create a new version of internet, a version which is decentralized. What does decentralized actually mean ? It means that we might have the support to do more things directly from peer to peer, instead of having a intermediary. How will it benefit the end user ? A lot of end user like me are not having much problem with the current internet and don‚Äôt directly see a need for a new version, but once things shape up we might start seeing its applications and benefits.
My next bigger doubt is in the area of web3 based applications. In the current web apps, the complete software is managed by the application developer team. How the web3 application‚Äôs backend will be decentralized ?
Will the frontend and backend architecture change once web3 is ready ? Are we going to do some web3 based optimizations for the requests which are going on the internet ?
Clearly there are a lot of questions. I will be going over all the questions one by one in my next blogs.

#### [The tech architecture of Indian Health Id](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;15&#x2F;The-tech-architecture-of-India&#39;s-health-id.html) 
*On Sept 27, PM launched the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, which would facilitate the management of the patient‚Äôs health data using a unique health Id. This mission has the potential of bringing a revolutionary change in the health care infrastructure in India.
In this blog, I will walk you through a brief overview of the Tech architecture.
User Flow


Common Use Cases
For Health Care Providers
Create a health Id for their patients if they don‚Äôt have the health Id already
Link the health Id in their internal system if the user already has the health Id.
Access the patient‚Äôs previous data (consent required)
Save the patient‚Äôs consultation and other medical data
For Patients
Create their own health Id
See their health records
Provide consent for accessing the health record.

Tech Architecture
The main software systems involved are:
HIU (Health information user): The system that requests the health data.
HIP(Health Information Provider): The system that provides the health data.
App for the user (PHR App&#x2F;ADBM Health Records): An interface for the user to access and manage their health data.
So who would create the HIU and HIP? As per the current architecture, private companies or startups can create and sell the HIU and HIP systems. The patient‚Äôs document will be stored with the HIP only and not the government, government will just maintain a registry ( a mapping between a health record to the HIP which stores that particular record).
The actual tech flows involve a lot of services in between like Gateway, Registry, Consent Manager etc. To keep the blog simple, I have removed some of those flows.
The below diagram depicts a top-level flow between the various services.


Summary
This framework provides an easy and complete solution for the communication between the various stack holders involved in the tech stack. The next challenge ahead is to figure out how to make this facility accessible to everyone in India and how a private practitioner can use this service.
Hope you enjoyed reading the blog. Please provide your suggestions and feedback.

#### [Understanding the Kubernetes for beginner](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;10&#x2F;Understanding-kubernetes-for-begineer.html) 
*Kubernetes in one of the important tech Buzzword in the market. All the documents out are explaining the features and advantages of it but for a new developer it is quite difficult to relate to it. This blog covers why do we need kubernetes.
The current blog requires an understanding of why do we need containerization. Please refer my blog on containerization here.
The containerization of the application solved the issue of setting up the environment. Our next challenges are:
How can we run this containers on the cloud ? We can run this containers on a VM, but what if we get more traffic and we need to scale up our infrastructure?
How can we make sure that we aren‚Äôt underutilized our VMs ?
If I am using multiple services, how can I easily manage the communication between them ?
To deploy the service, one way is to manually ssh into the VM and run our containers. But as the number of services grows then managing this manual process looks like a lot of task.
The solution to all the above issues is Kubernetes. It is used to deploy the container images on your cloud infrastructure. It is a very powerful tool with a lot of capabilities. It also allows us to scale up&#x2F;scale down the resources as per the traffic, do deployments easily and safely and also utilize our resources properly.
So if you are an enterprise which is growing quite fast and want your tech to keep us the pace, then you can try out Kubernetes. Hope you find this blog useful.*
#### [The various garbage collection strategies](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;07&#x2F;The-various-garbage-collection-strategies.html) 
*We recently came across an issue where our services were restarting multiple times due to max CPU usage. It took us some time to figure out the root cause, but by changing the GC strategy we were able to reduce the frequency of the outage. In this blog I present to you the various garbage collection strategies.
One of the most attractive feature of Java is the Garbage collections, unlike C++ we don‚Äôt need to worry about the memory leakage, we don‚Äôt have to explicitly call the free method.
JVM supports quite some garbage collector strategies and some of them are experimental too. Most garbage collectors work by splitting the heap into generations. These are called the old generation and the young generation. The young generation is further divided into sections known as eden and the survivor spaces.
The rational of diving the heap space into two generations is:
The young generation is only a portion of the entire heap, processing it is faster than processing the entire heap. The application threads are stopped for a much shorter period of time than if the entire heap were processed at once. You probably see a trade-off there, since it also means that the application threads are stopped more frequently than they would be if the JVM waited to perform GC until the entire heap were full. It is almost always a big advantage to have the shorter pauses even though they will be more frequent.
The second advantage arises from the way objects are allocated in the young generation. Objects are allocated in eden (which encompasses the vast majority of the young generation). When the young generation is cleared during a collection, all objects in eden are either moved or discarded: objects that are not in use can be discarded, and objects in use are moved either to one of the survivor spaces or to the old generation. Since all surviving objects are moved, the young generation is automatically
compacted when it is collected.
As you consider which garbage collector is appropriate for your situation, think about the overall performance goals that must be met. Trade-offs exist in every situation. In an application measuring the response time of individual requests, consider these points:
The individual requests will be impacted by pause times‚Äîand more importantly by long pause times for full GCs. If minimizing the effect of pauses on response times is the goal, a concurrent collector may be more appropriate.
If the average response time is more important than the outliers (i.e., the 90th%) response time), a nonconcurrent collector may yield better results.
The benefit of avoiding long pause times with a concurrent collector comes at the expense of extra CPU usage. If your machine lacks the spare CPU cycles needed by a concurrent collector, a nonconcurrent collector may be the better choice.
The various GC Algorithms are:
The Serial Garbage Collector: 
It uses a single thread to process the heap. It will stop all application threads as the heap is processed (for either a minor or full GC). During a full GC, it will fully compact the old generation.
The Throughput collector: 
It uses multiple threads to collect the young generation, which makes minor GCs much faster than when the serial collector is used. This uses multiple threads to process the old generation as well. Because it uses multiple threads, the throughput collector is often called the parallel collector. The throughput collector stops all application threads during both minor and full GCs, and it fully compacts the old generation during a full GC.
The G1 GC collector:
The G1 GC (or garbage first garbage collector) uses a concurrent collection strategy to collect the heap with minimal pauses. In G1 GC, the old generation is processed by background threads that don‚Äôt need to stop the application threads to perform most of their work. Because the old generation is divided into regions, G1 GC can clean up objects from the old generation by copying from one region into another, which means that it (at least partially) compacts the heap during normal processing. The trade-off for avoiding the full GC cycles is CPU time: the (multiple) background threads G1 GC uses to process the old generation must have CPU cycles available at the same time the application threads are running.
These were the three main garbage collectors. In next blog I would like to cover what are the things we take care of during selecting a garbage collector.*
#### [How to take thread dumps for a java service running in k8s](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;10&#x2F;06&#x2F;How-to-take-thread-dumps.html) 
*Recently I came across this interesting problem, where I wanted to take a thread dump of a java service. Our service was restarting multiple times because of which were were not able to download the thread dump at the time of CPU outage. This blogs covered how we were finally able to get the thread dump.
We used the Persistent Volume concept from the Kubernetes.
Concepts
PersistentVolume: This is the actual store where we will store the data. Conceptually it is similar to nodes, i.e. we don‚Äôt actually interact much with nodes, we have an abstract concept pod built on top of it.
PersistentVolumeClaim: We are claiming some volume. In pods, we can directly refer to the claim.
Steps to create an link a Persistent Volume
Create a Persistent Volume Claim using kubectl apply -f pvc-demo.yaml.

# pvc-demo.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-demo-2
  namespace: default
spec:
  storageClassName: standard
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 75Gi



Check that the PVC is created kubectl get pvc --namespace default.
Change the deployment config to use this PVC in the volumes section.

 - name: heap-dumps
    persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: pvc-demo-2


Redeploy the service using kubectl apply -f manager.yaml.
Now all the data inside heapdump is preserved.
Hope you find this blog useful when taking a thread dump for a service which is restarting frequently.*
#### [A short guide on java polymorphic deserialization](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;09&#x2F;15&#x2F;A-short-guide-to-jackson.html) 
*Jackson is the java library to perform serialization and deserialization. So whenever we want to convert a JSON to Java object (deserialization) or whenever we want to convert a Java Object to JSON, we can use the jackson library.
The polymorphic deserialization refers to deserializing the JSON into any of the subclass based on the type information present in the JSON.
Take an example of Zoo class. If we are given a JSON representation of the zoo class, how our java runtime will know whether it should create an object of type Dog or Cat ?

  public class Zoo {
    public Animal animal;
  }

  static class Animal { &#x2F;&#x2F; All animals have names, for our demo purposes... 
     public String name;
     protected Animal() { }
  }

  static class Dog extends Animal {
    public double barkVolume; &#x2F;&#x2F; in decibels
    public Dog() { }
  }

  static class Cat extends Animal {
    boolean likesCream;
    public int lives;
    public Cat() { }
  }


We can use the jackson annotation to let the library know how it can serialize&#x2F;deserialize a particular object.
The annotation is applied on the parent class as shown below

 @JsonTypeInfo(use&#x3D;JsonTypeInfo.Id.CLASS, include&#x3D;JsonTypeInfo.As.PROPERTY, property&#x3D;&quot;@class&quot;)
 class Animal { } 


What does that mean?
All instances of annotated type and its subtypes use these settings (unless overridden by another annotation)
‚ÄúType identifier‚Äù to use is fully-qualified Java class name (like ‚Äúorg.codehaus.jackson.sample.Animal‚Äù)
Type identifier is to be included as a (meta-)property, along with regular data properties; using name ‚Äú@class‚Äù (default name to use depend on type if: for classes it would be ‚Äú@class‚Äù)
Use default type resolver (no @JsonTypeResolver added); as well as default type id resolver (no @JsonTypeIdResolver)
We could have chosen differently as follows:
Type id: possible choices are CLASS (fully-qualified Java class name), MINIMAL_CLASS (relative Java class name, if base class and sub-class are in same package, leave out package name), NAME (use logical name, separately defined, to determine actual class) and CUSTOM (type id handled using custom resolver). To specify a custom type name, use the annotion @JsonTypeName on the sub class or JsonSubTypes on the parent class.
Inclusion: possible choices are PROPERTY (include as regular property along with member properties), WRAPPER_OBJECT (use additional JSON wrapper object; type id used as field name, actual serializer Object as value), WRAPPER_ARRAY (first element is type id; second element serialized Object)
Property name: for inclusion method of PROPERTY, can use any name; defaults depend on type id.
To plug in custom type id resolver use @JsonTypeIdResolver
To plug in custom type resolver use @JsonTypeResolver
Hope you enjoyed the blog!

#### [Difference between Merge and Rebase](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;08&#x2F;29&#x2F;Difference-between-Merge-and-Rebase.html) 
*In my initial days of git, I was a lot confused about merge and rebase. Though both works, it was not much clear which one to use. This post dives into the basic difference between the two.
Consider the scenerio when you are working on a feature branch. The feature branch has moved some commits ahead, and so is the main branch.

Now we want to get all the extra new commits from the main branch into the feature branch. There are two ways we can do it, we can either merge main branch to our feature branch, or we can rebase our feature branch on the main branch.  What is the differenece between the two appraoches
Git Merge
Git Merge takes all the new commits from the main branch, combines it together and applies it as big commit on our feature branch.

Git Rebase
The Git Rebase applies the commits from the feature branch one by one, on the top of the main branch first. Then it makes the feature branch point to the head of this new commits.

The main differene between the two is that how the git commit history is maintained. In the git merge case, all the commits of the merge branch will be present as a single commit in our feature branch. Whereas in the git rebase case all the commits of the main branch are as it is available in our feature branch and it will look like we started working from the HEAD of the main branch.

#### [The ESR Rule for creating the mongo indexes](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;04&#x2F;11&#x2F;The-ESR-Rule-For-Indexes.html) 
*In my present company, we place a lot of emphasis on optimizing the database queries. We create and review indexes for every each and every query. In this blog I present what are the best practices we follow.
If your table&#x2F;collection has millions of data, then you can use mongo indexes to optimize your queries. The mongo indexes are stored as a B+ tree. If you want to see how a query will work using a index, you can visualize the B+ tree where after the parent node you select the next node based on filter given in the query.
For compound indexes the ESR rules helps us decide the order of fields
First, add those fields against which Equality queries are run.
The next fields to be indexed should reflect the Sort order of the query.
The last fields represent the Range of data to be accessed.
For the equality query we give more priority to that fields which has the maximum cardinality (possible number of values of that field).*
#### [Why do we need docker ?](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;03&#x2F;10&#x2F;Understanding-docker-for-begineers.html) 
*There are a lot of blogs on what and how of docker but there are quite few blogs on why to use docker. As a beginner I struggled with why exactly we want to use it. In this blog I will be answering this question.
In 2018, I was working on the OpenPrinting project. The OpenPrinting handles all the code which is required for handling printers and printing using a linux machine. I was using the c code and sometimes I faced issues in running the code as either some required library was missing in my OS or the version of the required library was different in my system. Every developer who is using this application will have to go through the same process.
What happens if we try to deploy this application on a server ? Then we will have to ensure that all the libraries should be correctly installed on the server.
Oh that‚Äôs a lot of work!. What if we can create a container and keep all the required libraries and our application in that container and simply run the container. This way the developers can run the code on any OS and need not worry about the OS.
This is just one use case that is solved by docker, there are other use cases too like
In my current role, I am using Redis(for cache), MongoDB (for database) and my frontend code. If I was manually running this applications then I will have to install all their required libraries. What is MongoDB requires a different version of a library and Redis requires a different version of the same library? The how will I run both this services together ? To solve this issue we can run the application in a docker container. For my local development, I use three docker containers, one for 
Redis, one for MongoDB and one for Frontend code.
If a new person joins the organization, instead of running tons of command to setup the environment, he&#x2F;she can use the docker containers for the libraries or dependencies.
All the new DevOps tools have robust support for docker containers which makes it easy to deploy the services using it.
One of my startup friend was asking that whether he should use docker tool for his startup. When you are just starting a new startup you might not face the problems mentioned above and might not need to use docker. Anyways for a very early stage startup AWS provides quite some good DevOps tool.
Hope you find this blog useful.

#### [Managing enums with custom values](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;deepak0405.github.io&#x2F;coding-tapri&#x2F;2021&#x2F;02&#x2F;20&#x2F;Managing-Custom-Values-For-Enums.html) 
*Did you came across a use case where you wanted to add a custom value for a enum ? This blog covers how we can use custom values in our enums.
The most common form in which an enum is used is

public enum Animal {
    DOG,
    CAT
}


We had a special case where
We wanted to return to value Dog (instead of DOG) and Cat(Instead of CAT) to the users in API.
Use the custom value of the enum in our internal logics.
How can we solve this problem using the same enum class?
We can define a custom value for our enum like:

public enum Animal {
  @JsonProperty(&quot;Dog&quot;) DOG(&quot;Dog&quot;),
  @JsonProperty(&quot;Cat&quot;) Cat(&quot;Cat&quot;)

  private final String displayName;

  Animal(String displayName) {
    this.displayName &#x3D; displayName;
  }

  @JsonValue
  public String getDisplayName() {
    return displayName;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return displayName;
  }

  @JsonCreator(mode &#x3D; JsonCreator.Mode.DELEGATING)
  public static Animal getAnimalEnum(@JsonProperty(&quot;type&quot;) String displayName) {
    for (Animal animalType : Animal.values()) {
      if (animalType.displayName.equalsIgnoreCase(displayName)) {
        return animalType;
      }
    }
    throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Invalid value: &quot; + displayName);
  }
}


Description of the above code example:
We have define the value custom value as the displayName of the enum
When we are deserializing a value to Animal enum the function with the annotation JsonCreator will be called
When we are serializing the enum value the function with the JsonValue annotation is called*
